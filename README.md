[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.6+. This package implements :Gateway support for Omnipay.

**Note:** Replace `:vendor`, `:gateway`, `:Gateway`, `:author_name`, `:author_website`, `:author_email`, `:year`, `:package_description`, `:package_source_url`, `:package_contributions_url`, `:package_support_url` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line and the setup.sh file. Or use the ./setup.sh for a quick start.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.

## Install

Install the gateway using require. Require the `league/omnipay` base package and this gateway.
